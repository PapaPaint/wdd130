                        Disable startup programs that are not essential.
                        Upgrade RAM for improved multitasking capabilities.
                        Consider upgrading to a solid-state drive (SSD) for faster boot times and application loading.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Software Crashes or Freezes:</h2>

                        Scan for malware and viruses using reputable antivirus software.
                        Perform a system restore to revert to a previous stable state.
                        Use diagnostic tools like Windows Memory Diagnostic to check for RAM issues.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Internet Connectivity Problems:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Power cycle the modem and router by unplugging them for 30 seconds and then plugging them back in.
                        Check network cables and ensure they are securely connected.
                        Update router firmware to the latest version.
                        Reset TCP/IP stack by running commands like "netsh int ip reset" in Command Prompt (Windows) or "sudo service network-manager restart" in Terminal (Linux).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):</h2>
                    <p>
                        Check for recently installed hardware or software and uninstall them if they coincide with the BSOD occurrence.
                        Run a memory diagnostic test to check for faulty RAM modules.
                        Update device drivers, especially graphics card and chipset drivers.
                        Perform a system file check by running the "sfc /scannow" command in Command Prompt (Windows).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Overheating:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clean dust and debris from the computer's vents, fans, and heat sinks using compressed air.
                        Ensure proper airflow by keeping the computer in a well-ventilated area and not obstructing air intake/exhaust.
                        Apply fresh thermal paste to the CPU if temperatures remain high after cleaning.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Noisy Fans:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clean dust from the fan blades and bearings using compressed air.
                        Tighten loose screws or mounts that may be causing vibrations.
                        Consider replacing the fan if it continues to make excessive noise after cleaning and tightening.
